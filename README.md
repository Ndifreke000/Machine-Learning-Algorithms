# Machine Learning Engineer/Data Analyst, Greysoft Technologies,  Kaduna, Kaduna State, June 2023 – Present

  a)	Used R to measure features importance and then communicate the correlations between these features with some visualisations
### Insights Gained:
   i.	Column-specific outlier treatment ensures robustness in income and biochemical data.
   ii.	Adjustment of missing or erroneous values in the `Maternal income` column using mean or median values.
   iii.	Imputation of missing values contributes to a more comprehensive dataset.
# Purpose:
    i.	Enhancing Dataset Reliability: The collaborative effort, with a particular focus on data cleaning led by me, aimed to enhance the reliability of the dataset. This is crucial for ensuring the robustness of subsequent analyses, such as statistical modelling or machine learning.
    ii.	Ensuring Data Integrity: By actively participating in outlier treatment and addressing missing values, our team strived to ensure the dataset is free from distortions that could impact the accuracy and validity of analytical outcomes. 
    
   b)	Using Power-BI to visualize and track the status progress and interest rate of remote workers in relation to non-remote workers.
# Insights Gained:
    i.	Identifying Trends: The collaborative effort focused on uncovering trends in the progress and interest rates of both remote and non-remote workers over time. Patterns were scrutinized to reveal seasonal variations or external factors influencing performance.
    ii.	Remote Work Effectiveness: Our team aimed to determine the impact of remote work on productivity compared to traditional office setups. This involved a comprehensive analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) and progress metrics.
    iii.	Employee Satisfaction: Explored the correlation between interest rates and job satisfaction to understand if higher rates indicated increased employee contentment.
# Purpose:
    i.	Performance Monitoring of Remote vs. Non-Remote: Collaboratively analysed performance metrics to discern the comparison between remote and non-remote workers, focusing on completed tasks and project deliveries.
    ii.	Interest Rate Analysis between Remote vs. Non-Remote: Our joint efforts delved into exploring the differences in interest rates between remote and non-remote workers. The purpose was to gain insights into factors influencing employee commitment and enthusiasm.
   c)	Sentiment Analysis of Tweets During ASUU Strike using Machine Learning.
# Insights Gained:
    i.	Public Sentiment Analysis: As a collaborative team effort, insights into public sentiments during the ASUU strike were obtained. The focus was on understanding the distribution of sentiments (negative, neutral, positive) to gauge the overall mood and perception of the public.
    ii.	Sentiment Trends over Time: Collectively analysed sentiment trends during various phases of the ASUU strike, aiming to reveal crucial turning points and events that had a significant impact on public opinion.
 # Purpose:
    i.	Understanding Public Opinion: The primary team goal was to gain a profound understanding of public opinion during the ASUU strike. Social media, particularly Twitter, served as a platform for individuals to express views, and our sentiment analysis quantified and categorized these opinions.
    ii.	Issue Identification and Resolution: The team collaborated to utilize sentiment analysis as a proactive tool for early identification of emerging issues. This collective effort allowed stakeholders to address concerns promptly, potentially preventing escalation of negative sentiment.
